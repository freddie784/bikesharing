## Overview

The Purpose of this project was to create a story through data visualization to show investors why they should invest in a bike business in Des Moines Iowa similar to CitiBike in New York City.

## Results
 
Below are the results that were gathered from the NYC CitiBike data in August

- This data show the amount of Rides in August and where it was most popular to start. There were over 2.3 million riders who used the bikes most frequently at 8am and 5pm.

- The data showed people do not ride for longer than an hour so we should charge by the minute, per ride, or subscription.

- This is a heatmap of dates and times the bikes are used. The most frequent times are Monday - Friday at 8am and 5pm which leads to the assumption people use the bikes for traveling to and from work.

- These are heatmaps breaking down gender usage. It seems both are using them for the same purpose; however, males are the primary users of the services and a majority are subscribed to the service.

## Summary

After reviewing the data there were metrics that hinted as to what the bikes would be used for and by who mostly. The bikes were being used Monday - Friday at 8am and 5pm by both genders which leads to the assumption people use the bikes for traveling to and from work using the premise that people are working 9am-5pm. Also a majority of the users were male which leads to a possible target audience. I would want to delve further int the data and find out what age groups customers are and how many are subscribers to better cater our advertising. Below is the data visualization that would help with researching this information.
